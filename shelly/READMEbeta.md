## General Notes

Suport openHAB version:
- **4.2**: Current DEV build [Current DEV build 4.2.0-SNAPSHOT](https://github.com/markus7017/myfiles/blob/master/shelly/org.openhab.binding.shelly-4.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar)
- **4.1**: Last DEV build [Current DEV build 4.1.0-SNAPSHOT](https://github.com/markus7017/myfiles/blob/master/shelly/org.openhab.binding.shelly-4.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar)
- **4.0**: Last DEV build [Current DEV build 4.0.0-SNAPSHOT](https://github.com/markus7017/myfiles/blob/master/shelly/org.openhab.binding.shelly-4.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar)
- **3.4**: Last DEV build [Current DEV build 3.4.0-SNAPSHOT](https://github.com/markus7017/myfiles/blob/master/shelly/org.openhab.binding.shelly-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar)
- **3.3**: As is, no longer maintained. [Current DEV build](https://github.com/markus7017/myfiles/blob/master/shelly/org.openhab.binding.shelly-3.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar)
- **3.2**: As is, no longer maintained.in the official stable OH distribution, [Latest DEV build](https://github.com/markus7017/myfiles/blob/master/shelly/org.openhab.binding.shelly-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar)
- **3.1**: No longer supported, [Last DEV build](https://github.com/markus7017/myfiles/blob/master/shelly/org.openhab.binding.shelly-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar)
- **3.0**: No longer supported, [Last DEV build](https://github.com/markus7017/myfiles/blob/master/shelly/org.openhab.binding.shelly-3.0.3-SNAPSHOT.jar)
- **2.5**: No longer supported. [Last DEV  build](https://github.com/markus7017/myfiles/blob/master/shelly/org.openhab.binding.shelly-2.5.13-SNAPSHOT.jar)

Be ware that there are
- the release distro package, which includes a stable version of the binding
- the official SNAPSHOT / milestone build could be found [here](https://openhab.jfrog.io/artifactory/libs-pullrequest-local/org/openhab/addons/bundles/org.openhab.binding.shelly/), which might include a newer binding version, but will never be as current as the DEV build
- the DEV build: Latest and archived versions could be found in [myfiles repo](https://github.com/markus7017/myfiles/tree/master/shelly)

If you want to use the SNAPSHOT/DEV build you can **NOT** install it using the UI. 
Make sure that the release version is not installed: Check that Shelly is not installed, uninstall if so. 

There is no strict dependency on the OH base version, e.g. you could run binding 3.1-SNAPSNOT on top of openHAB 3.0.1.

Gen1: Use Shelly device firmware version 1.9.2 or newer - you could use device UI or Shelly Manager to install the update.
Gen2: Use Shelly device firmware version 0.12 or newer

## Installing DEV build

### New Install

- Uninstall Shelly binding form UI
- Download the jar from the [myfiles repo](https://github.com/markus7017/myfiles/tree/master/shelly), e.g. org.openhab.binding.shelly-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar or org.openhab.binding.shelly-4.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
  Note: If you download via curl or wget and not manually from the github UI you need to add ***?raw=true** to the URL to make sure getting a binary file
- open OH console, run "feature:install openhab-transport-coap"
- Stop OH
- copy org.openhab.binding.shelly-xxx-SNAPSHOT.jar to OH's addons folder
- start OH, run discovery

If everything was install correct a "bundle:list" output show be similar to this:

```
283 │ Active │ 80 │ 0.3.0.v20220506-1020 │ EdDSA-Java
284 │ Active │ 80 │ 2.7.4 │ Californium (Cf) Core
285 │ Active │ 80 │ 2.7.4 │ Californium (Cf) Element Connector
286 │ Active │ 80 │ 2.7.4 │ Californium (Cf) OSGi
287 │ Active │ 80 │ 2.7.4 │ Scandium (Sc) Core
282 │ Active │ 80 │ 4.2.0.202401061653 │ openHAB Add-ons :: Bundles :: Shelly Binding Gen 1,2,3 and BLU
```
### Updating DEV version

Channel definitions are subject to change with any alpha or beta release. Please make sure to **delete all Shelly things before updating*** the binding and clean out the JSON DB:

- **remove all Shelly things** (UI: no worries, they get re-discoverd; and .things file)
- delete the existing binding jar from the addons folder, wait until OH unloaded the binding (check the OH log)
- open OH console ("openhab-cli console")
- run "bundle:list | grep Shelly" and make sure that the binding is gone
- otherwise run "bundle:uninstall <bundle id as listed from above (1st column)>"
- run "feature:install openhab-transport-coap"
- stop OH ("openhab-cli stop"), wait until everything is stopped (could take some time)
- copy binding jar or kar into addons (set correct permission)
- start oh service ("openhab-cli start")
- **re-discover things**
- the channel/item linkage should be restored automatically
- verify the linked channels, maybe the are new ones and in rare cases I rename channels for consistency.

### Binding does not start (does not show status=active), doesn't show up

Sometimes there are left-overs when removing bindings. In this case try to

- stop OH
- run "openhab-cli clean-cache"
- start OH wait a while until fully initialized
- open OH console, run "feature:install openhab-transport-coap"
- copy jar to addons folder
- run bundle:list on the OH console and make sure, Shelly binding shows up with status active

## Additional Notes

### Reporting a problem/bug

Check the [community thread](https://community.openhab.org/t/shelly-binding/) first - maybe others already solved the problem:.

If you encounter a problem you could put the binding into DEBUG or TRACE mode.

- open OH console (execute "openhab-cli console")
- set the bindings's log level: "log:set DEBUG org.openhab.binding.shelly" or "log:set TRACE org.openhab.binding.shelly" for even more details
- issue command or wait until problem occurs
- save openhab.log
- remove all stuff not related to the problem
- anomynize all specific data of your installation (e.g. credentials for password protected devices, SSID)

## Other devices

Check the README.md for supported devices.
If you have one of those devices send me a PM and we could work on the implementation/testing.

## Supporting new devices

You could help to integrate and support new devices. In general the following information is a good start

For Gen1 devices:

- open a browser and issue the following urls
- http://&lt;device ip&gt;/settings
- http://&lt;device ip&gt;/status

For Gen2 devices:

- open a browser and issue the following urls
- http://&lt;device ip&gt;/rpc/Shelly.GetConfig
- http://&lt;device ip&gt;/rpc/Shelly.GetStatus

CoIoT support for Gen1 devices:

- enable CoIoT events within the thing configuration
- open the thing properties ([Show Properties])
- and copy&amp;paste the coapDescr property
